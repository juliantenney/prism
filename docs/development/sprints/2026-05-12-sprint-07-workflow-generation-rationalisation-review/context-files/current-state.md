# PRISM Current State

## Strategic Position

PRISM is in a **v1.0 stabilisation and rationalisation** phase focused on architectural clarity, continuity, and reduction of conceptual drift—not open-ended feature expansion.

## Strongest Current Capabilities

- Prompt Studio for structured prompt refinement
- Prompt Library for reusable prompt storage and management
- Manual Workflow Builder and step-by-step workflow execution
- Utilities pipeline for HTML-oriented rendering and export
- Domain-pack constrained workflow context loading

## Current Consolidation Priorities

- preserve runtime and manifest path stability
- keep architecture and filesystem structure coherent
- maintain explicit workflow semantics and artefact contracts
- improve continuity documentation and check-in discipline
- archive legacy content rather than deleting

## Focus and Scope Notes

- workflow generation rationalisation is the **next bounded consolidation focus** (Sprint 07 — review-first; see consolidation doc)
- domain-pack and generation **redesign** remain out of scope until Sprint 07 audit recommendations are explicit
- tidy-up/governance phase is complete
- continuity workflow is now operational
- shared operational vocabulary is established
- recent documentation cleanup and archive moves are complete
- conservative artefacts naming policy is retained for stability
- consolidation sprint structure now exists under `docs/consolidation/`
- sprint transition portability now uses `docs/development/sprints/YYYY-MM-DD-sprint-name/`
- backlog system now exists under `docs/backlog/`
- manual workflow builder and definition foundations are stabilised; generation pipeline rationalisation is now the active planning/review track (Sprint 07)
- Prompt Studio consolidation model is now explicit:
  - brief state = user-authored refinement inputs/parameters
  - runtime refinement session state = transient conversational refinement lifecycle
  - prompt asset state = durable Prompt Library entity
- workflow prompt context is treated as a secondary/future consideration in Sprint 01, not a driver of current Prompt Studio design

## Next Active Focus

- **Sprint 07 — Workflow Generation Rationalisation Review** (review-first; planning and audit only until explicitly scoped): `docs/consolidation/sprint-07-workflow-generation-rationalisation-review.md`
- Portable sprint pack: `docs/development/sprints/2026-05-12-sprint-07-workflow-generation-rationalisation-review/`
- **Sprint 06 documentation alignment is complete** — closure: `docs/consolidation/sprint-06-check-in-closure.md`
- Consolidation vocabulary baseline: `docs/development/shared-vocabulary.md` (validation lifecycle, prompt attachment modes, import/export narrative, step identity, continuity artefacts)

## Sprint Status Notes

- Sprint 01 - Prompt Studio Consolidation completed its first pass.
- Sprint 01 outcomes: clearer Prompt Studio semantics/state boundaries, improved refinement lifecycle and payload/display clarity, and narrow accessibility/technical-debt cleanup.
- Sprint 02 - Prompt Library Consolidation passes 1-3 completed:
  - lifecycle contract comments and helper extraction landed in `app.js` without schema/runtime redesign
  - Prompt Library lifecycle flows (new/save/delete/duplicate/use/copy/export/import) were verified stable
  - canonical durable state remains `state.prompts` + `state.selectedPromptId`; filters/list/detail/version views remain derived projections
  - preserved policy: `usageCount` increments only on Use as template; duplicate keeps historical versions and adds duplicate/save snapshots; metadata ownership remains split between handlers and `Library` persistence
- Sprint 02 Prompt Library Consolidation is completed and committed.
- Sprint 03 Workflow Runtime Consolidation (review + passes 1-2) completed:
  - clarified workflow definition vs runtime navigation semantics
  - documented and stabilized run-mode lifecycle/reset inspectability without behavior redesign
  - clarified Prompt Studio workflow hydration/save boundary semantics for step outcomes
  - improved internal input-binding chip inspectability with source-step identity display only
  - manual smoke checks confirmed workflow runtime compatibility preserved
- Sprint 03 intentionally deferred:
  - run-mode redesign/state-machine work
  - schema/storage restructuring
  - workflow generation/domain-pack redesign
  - app.js module-boundary restructuring
- Sprint 03 Workflow Runtime Consolidation is completed, continuity-updated, smoke-checked, and stabilised for check-in.
- Sprint 04 — Workflow Definition Consolidation — completed and checked in (bounded, behavior-preserving):
  - Pass 1: prompt attachment canonicalization helper extraction
  - Pass 2: UI read-path consolidation for prompt attachment state projection
  - Pass 3: canonical step identity clarification (`step.id` vs `canonical_step_id`)
  - Pass 4: validation lifecycle clarification (normalize→validate where owned; warning-only/non-mutating contract; caller-owned surfacing)
  - no schema/runtime/import/export redesign introduced
- Sprint 05 — Manual verification (post-Sprint 04) — **closed, verification-only, checked in:**
  - smoke passed: load/select/render, create/edit/save, prompt attachment modes, validation warnings non-blocking, import/export, run-mode boundary sanity
  - no regressions requiring implementation changes
  - domain-pack generated workflows use local override for unsaved/default prompt assets as expected
  - closure: `docs/consolidation/sprint-05-check-in-closure.md`
- Sprint 06 — Continuity & documentation alignment — **closed (docs-only):**
  - terminology aligned across consolidation notes, `shared-vocabulary.md`, and `development-protocol.md`
  - closure: `docs/consolidation/sprint-06-check-in-closure.md`
- Sprint 07 — Workflow Generation Rationalisation Review — **active (review-first):**
  - domain packs, generation pipeline, elicitation, brief form, LD design-information balance; no implementation until audit complete and follow-on scoped
  - planning: `docs/consolidation/sprint-07-workflow-generation-rationalisation-review.md`
- Deferred from Sprint 01 by design:
  - major `app.js` size reduction (requires later module-boundary sprint)
  - generated workflow integration decisions
  - broader UI polish

## Active Focus Areas

- Prompt Studio
- Prompt Library
- Manual Workflow Builder
- workflow semantics
- artefact contracts
- workflow generation rationalisation (Sprint 07 — review-first)
