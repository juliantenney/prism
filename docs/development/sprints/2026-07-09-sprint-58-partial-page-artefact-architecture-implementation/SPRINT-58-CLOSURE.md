# Sprint 58 — Closure Report

**Sprint:** 58 — Partial Page Artefact Architecture Implementation  
**Closed:** 2026-07-14  
**Status:** Complete  
**Predecessor:** Sprint 57A (closed)

---

## Delivered

- Transcript prompt-resolution fix (Normalize Content Prompt Factory JSON parse)
- Workflow-step-based partial validation routing (`validatePartialPageCaptureForStep`)
- Design Page partial contract injection (`LD-DESIGN-PAGE-PARTIAL-CONTRACT` in `partialPageOutputs` mode)
- Design Page domain §13 alignment (`page_synthesis`-first; compose rollback/legacy-only in domain seed)
- Sprint 58 workflow flag preservation through run-mode resolution (`resolveWorkflowForUpstreamArtefacts` merges `pageEnrichmentV2` / `partialPageOutputs`)
- Simple-topic and transcript fixture-backed E2E coverage (capture → persist → assemble → render)
- Rollback and legacy behaviour preserved (`partialPageOutputs: false` / `pageEnrichmentV2: false` retain compose)

## Canonical architecture

```
Learning outcomes
  → Episode Plan full shell
  → DLA partial
  → GAM partial
  → assessment design and assessment items
  → Learning Sequence partial
  → Design Page page_synthesis partial
  → deterministic assembly
  → render
```

Gates: `pageEnrichmentV2` + `partialPageOutputs` enable the partial path. Post-EP steps use conversation context (no fenced upstream page JSON injection).

## Canonical ownership

| Owner | Owns |
| ----- | ---- |
| Episode Plan | Page shell (title, audience, page_profile, learning_outcomes, episode_plans, activity skeletons) |
| DLA | `activities[]` instructional fields |
| GAM | `activities[].materials[]` hydrated bodies |
| Assessment | Assessment design and generated assessment items |
| Design Page | `page_synthesis` (canonical); `sections[]` optional dual-read only |
| Assembly | Deterministic merge (`lib/page-vnext-assemble.js`) |
| Renderer | Presentation only |

## Test evidence

### Targeted gates

- `tests/sprint-58-phase0-design-page-partial-gates.test.js` — partial injects partial contract; rollback/legacy retain compose
- `tests/sprint-58-phase1-design-page-domain-gates.test.js` — §13 page_synthesis-first; compose described as rollback-only
- `tests/sprint-58-flag-preservation-gates.test.js` — flag-only stubs, run-mode gather merge, explicit false, prompt surfaces

### Regression

- `tests/page-prompt-no-upstream-injection.test.js`
- `tests/page-vnext-assemble.test.js`
- `tests/page-partial-capture-validate.test.js`
- `tests/sprint-56c-wave1-phase1-gates.test.js` (and related 56C gates updated for §13)
- `tests/design-page-materials-fidelity.test.js` (domain pack assertions updated for vNext seed)

All targeted + Sprint 58 regression batches reported **green** at close (e.g. 70/70 on final flag-preservation regression run).

### E2E

- `tests/sprint-58-stabilisation-e2e.test.js`
  - Transcript brief (RNA viruses): Normalize → … → EP→DLA→GAM→LS→DP partial → assemble → HTML
  - Simple topic (inflation): topic path without Normalize; DP with `page_synthesis` only → assemble → HTML

### Live run-mode smoke

- Simulated run-mode gather (steps present, Sprint 58 flags omitted from gathered spec) + persisted migrated flags:
  - Design Page instructions include partial-mode / `page_synthesis` contract language
  - `LD-DESIGN-PAGE-COMPOSE-CONTRACT` absent
  - No GAM Content: / upstream full-page injection language

---

## Deferred work

- Hard Design Page ownership validation (reject shell / regenerated materials without false-reject evidence)
- Compose-contract reduction to rollback/legacy-only module scope
- Legacy architecture removal
- Renderer redesign (native `page_synthesis` + top-level `activities[]` presentation)
- Instructional-content richness review (scenario depth, wrapper prose quality)

---

## Known limitations

- Rollback and legacy paths remain intentionally supported
- `sections[]` remains optional dual-read compatibility output
- Renderer still uses legacy-shaped presentation assumptions (`page-render-normalize.js` adapters)
- Scenario and some instructional-content types remain too thin
- Assessment quality still requires explicit review of both design and item generation

---

## Explicit non-requirements (unchanged)

- Copilot reliably following partial contracts on every run (human review remains)
- Numeric instructional-budget calibration from Sprint 57A

---

## Next sprint guidance

**Successor opened:** [Sprint 59 — Instructional Content Richness Audit](../2026-07-14-sprint-59-instructional-content-richness-audit/SPRINT-59-START-HERE.md) (**diagnostic first**; Planned / Ready to Start).

Sprint 59 must complete the richness audit and produce a renderer input pack **before** renderer redesign or prompt campaigns. Architecture follow-ons remain deferred:

1. Soak live workflows on the four Sprint 58 commits (can run in parallel with Sprint 59 audit collection)
2. Later: evidence-gated Design Page hard ownership validation **or** compose-contract reduction — not both at once
